## Guide
Install dependencies:
`npm install`

This project uses the JSON Server, so you need to install it on your computer.

Install JSON Server:
`npm install -g json-server`

Run the JSON Server on port 3004, with the `--port` flag (you can use any other than port 3000, since that will be the one used by React):
`json-server --watch db.json --port 3004`

Start the app:
`npm start`
